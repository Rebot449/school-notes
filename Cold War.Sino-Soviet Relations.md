## Early relationship (The Stalin Era)
### Pre-PRC Period
Relations between the PRC and the USSR even in its earlier stages was off to a rocky start. The most notable of which was the ideological differences between both of them, Mao's interpretation of Marxism is that peasants would be the root of the revolution. In stark contrast to workers being the core of the revolution, this resulted in Stalin feeling that Mao couldn't lead to a proper Marxist Revolution. 

Relations were also further strained when Stalin never properly supported the CPC in the Chinese Civil War together with Stalin doing actions such as:
- fearing Mao as a rival for the leadership of the communist world
- didn't want the Cold War to spread to Asia
- underestimated the CPC and believed that GMD to be the stronger party. Even when the CPC victory was inveitable, Stalin still wanted them to unite with the GMD
- knew that Chiang would recognize Soviet claims to the disputed border territory along the border such as in Manchuria and Xinjiang

Mao further believed that Stalin wanted a divided and weak China when Stalin refused to let the CPC carry out a revolution and told him to collaborate with the GMD. This resulted in Mao seeing Stalin as another Tito.

### Sino-Soviet Treaty
When the CPC won the civil war, Mao was invited to visit Moscow in 1950. This trip despite producing the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance, the Chinese received a rather poor treatment and that the treaty was a result of many struggles according to Mao. Even Nikita Khrushchev saw the treaty as being another unfair treaty for the Chinese.

Nonetheless, Soviet planners and engineers were sent to China to aid in some 200 Chinese construction project in the 1950s.

### The Korean War
Despite the Soviets giving material assitance to the 1 million Chinese Troops engaging in battle. The Soviets still demanded that China pay for all weapons and amterials that the USSR has provided.

In total the relations between China and the Soviet Union did have some tension but it was not big enough to be a major issue for both nations.

## Khrushchev Era
### Initial Relations
With the death of Stalin, there were hopes for improved Sino-Soviet relations during Nikita Khrushchev's leadership. However there were 3 issues that resulted in tensions:
- Khrushchev's Secret Speech especially comments about the "Cult Personality" drew ire from Mao as Mao saw it as an attack on his own style of leadership.
- The crushing of the Hungarian uprising combined with Soviet problems in Poland and Germany made Mao saw that the Soviets were failing to contain reactionary forces.
- Mao also saw Khrushchev's doctrine of "Peaceful co-existence" as ideological Heresy

As a result, Mao saw that the Soviet Union is now dominated by "revisionists" with his viewpoint being further strengthened in the form of the 1955 Geneva Summit and the Austrian State Treaty.

### Conference of Communist Parties 1957
The Chinese goal during this conference were to to push the PRC's ideological stance and assert themselves as the true leaders of the international revolutionary Communism which the PRC were starting to see themselves as.
### Khrushchev's visit to Beijing, 1958
Despite Khrushchev's intention to ease the growing tension between the USSR and the PRC. Mao went out of his way to make Khrushchev to feel as miserable as possible. Not only was Khrushchev housed in a hotel that had no air conditioning and plagued by mosquitoes at the hieght of summer heat. Mao invited Khrushchev to his swimming pool for talks, knowing that Khrushchev hated swimming. Khrushchev was further annoyed with shorts that were too tight for him and had to be floated with the help of a rubber ring. The talks were not productive and was yet another platform for Deng Xiao Ping to attack Soviet policy.

### Taiwan 1958
Taiwan was a massive sticking point for the PRC as it was the final stronghold controlled by the Chiang Kai-Shek and his GMD. In 1958, Mao decided to test the US' resolve by building up troops in the region without consulting the USSR. This resulted in the USSR accusing Mao of being "Trotskyist" and pursuing international revolution at any cost and taking this as evidence of Mao being fanatical and lack understanding of political reality. Overall it resulted in the withdrawal of Soviet Economic advisers and cancellation of commerical contracts with further straining of their relationship.

### Great Leap Forward
The Great Leap Forward was generally considered a failure due to the starvation it caused. The Soviet Response to it was that it was faulty in designa and erroneous in practice. The Soviets further decalred that it was unorthodox and revelled in the failure and denounced Mao. Mao was personally furious at this as the USSR had undermined the PRC in the yes of the international Communist community.

### Albania 
China got its opportunity to attack the USSR in 1961 when Albania was attacked by the USSR for their regime and doctrine. Mao promised ted to replace Soviet Money and technical assistance to Albania. This resulted in the Severence of Sino-Soviet relations.

### The Sino-Indian War 1962
This war was one of the few circumstances where China was the sole beligerent as during the war, the USSR had sold MIG fighters to India despite staying "neutral". The US was allowed to fly U-2 planes from Charbatia, gaining sensitive intelligence. This also shattered China's relationship as a key member of the non-aligned movement alongside India.

### Cuban Missile Crisis
Despite averting a potential nuclear war, Mao and the PRC saw it as a betrayal of revolutionary cause. Mao mentioned that not only the Soviets had placed detectable missiles in the first place, they also backed down and produced a negative impact on the struggle against US imperialism. 

### Nuclear Weapons
Nuclear weapons development and usage was a major sticking point between the USSR and China. Mao opposed Khrushchev goal of peaceful coexistence and saw it as abandoning the revolution. This resulted in the USSR accusing the PRC of wanting the West and the USSR to destroy each other. The Soviet consistently rebuffed the PRC request for nuclear technology and if they really wanted help, they needed to conform to the USSR defence doctrine. Mao saw this as the USSR being patronizing and wasn't too concerned with nuclear catatrophe.

## Brezhnev Era
### The Cultural Revolution
The Cultural Revolution created a state of anarchy within China and further gave the Soviets more ammunition to attacked and isolate the PRC. As this event resulted in the Soviet denounced the PRC for being too fanatical and creating a state of anarchy. The Soviets also took the chance to attack the PRC with accusation such as:
- Trading illegaly with Apartheid South Africa
- receiving Nuclear Research assistance from West Germany
- Developing a worldwide opium trade
- sending supplies to US forces in Vietnam

### The Invasion fo Czechoslovakia
When Czechoslovakia attempted to assert some independence, Brezhnev's doctrine was put into place and crushed the Czechoslovakian government. Mao condemned the use of force because not only did the USSR stop behaving in a "Socialist Manner", he was worried that this doctrine could be used against China

### Sino-Soviet Border war 1969
Actual fighting broke out on the 2nd of March 1969 on Cheng-pao or Damansky Island in the Usuri River. Up until now, the Chinese had claimed that the Soviets had violated Chinese borders 4189 times. There was genuine feared that there would be all out war with a Soviet Invasion that could turn into a nuclear war. Despite Fighting continuing sporadically for most of the year, no escalation occured. This to some historian represented the lowest point in Sino-Soviet relations.

## Sino-Soviet relations and Indochina
Both China and the USSR competed for Vietnamese alliance with the USSR eventually winning by keeping up a steady supply of aid and arms throughout the Vietnam war. In 1978, Relations were formalized in the Soviet-Vietnamese Treaty of Peace and Friendship.

Having lost Vietnam, the PRC instead chose to form closer ties with Pol Pot's regime in Cambodia. In 24th December 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia to overthrow Pol Pot and also began to expel all Chinese people from the territory they occupied. China then came to the defense of Cambodia and on 17th February 1979 invaded Vietnam. The war was a major lost and setback for the PRC as they have now lost against the USSR propaganda.
## Sino-Soviet rapproachement
The key reasons for the relaxation of tensions were that:
- Mao Zedong had died in 1976
- The anti Soviet Gang of Four were overthrown
- Deng Xiaoping becoming the leader of the PRC
- Brezhnev death in 1982

With these event put into place, Sino-Soviet relations were beginning to ease as high-ranking Chinese officials attended Brezhnev's funeral. There were still several issues that divided the PRC and the USSR:
- the USSR invasion of Afghanistan
- Soviet troops on the border
- Soviet Support of the Vietnamese Occupation of Cambodia

### Mikhail Gorbachev and Deng Xiao Ping
With Gorbachev assuming Soviet leadership, there were real chances of improving Sino-Soviet relations. This was indeed Gorbachev's goal

In 1986, new trade agreements were drawn up and procedures for full diplomatic relations restored. 1987 Gorbachev attempted to meet Deng but the Chinese refused on the basis of the Vietnamese still occupying Cambodia. In May 1988, a culture exchange agreement was signed, signifying significant thaw in the relationship.

### Tiananmen Square 1989 and the end of the Soviet Union
A few days before Gorbachev's visit, there were protests in Tiananmen Square seeking for Democratic reform. The protestors welcomed Gorbachev as a hero of reform. A lot of this had to do with the fact that the USSR and the PRC had fundamental difference in terms of reforms.

It turned out that Deng's policy as the USSR collpased in 1990 due to the increased of political freedoms. The PRC didn't seize the international revolutionary initiative but instead continued to be a major world player.
