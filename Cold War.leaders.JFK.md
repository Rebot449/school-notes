- Attacked Eisenhower as well as being behind in terms of space technology.

- Increased Military spending by 13% per year, was largest and fastest peacetime military build up in US history

- Kennedy was more into conventional military as he reversed the budget cuts that Eisenhower did during his presidency

- "Flexible Response" policy, reasoning of how communist threat was much more diverse

- Continued Containment that was started by Truman by this time with more economic support especially with decolonisation in full steam
