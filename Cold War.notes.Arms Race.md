# The Impact of the arms race on the Cold War
## Initial Reactions to the Dawn of the Nuclear Bomb
- Started an arms ace which helped to maintain and continue hostility between the superpowers
- Caysed the redevelopment of military strategy and the way conflicts are handled during the Cold War
- Placed huge economic strains on both countries which played a role in ending the Cold War
## The Change in strategy during the Cold War
The destructive nature of the nuclear bomb driven both the USA and USSR to know that military victory in "Total War" is no longer possible. The continuing advances in technology further resulted in both sides becoming paranoid as both sides felt either they were vulnerable or losing in what they perceived as a **"nuclear gap"**. Despite the dangers, both sides believed there could be a strategy that made used of them otherwise Nuclear Weapons would be a pointless development. 

- **Massive Retaliation**, devised by Eisenhower and that if the US were ever attacked, they would respond by with every weapon they had.

- **Counterforce**, devised by Robert McNamara, Kennedy's chief of staff. The goal of counterforce was to destroy the enemy's military force and not civillian targets. There were several issues with the strategy: 
    - the issue of succesfully hitting a target accurately at early stages of missile development
    - hitting a military target without affecting a city when many targets are located near to cities
    - ensuring that the Soviets followed the same no cities rule

 ## Mutually Assured Destruction (Impact of the Cuban Missile Crisis)
 McNamara changed his idea on counterforce and isntead now advocated for the goal of causing as much casualties as possible. The belief now was that if no one could survive a nuclear war, no one would desire one.

 This became know as Mutually Assured Destruction shortened to MAD. This went bad to the idea first proposed by Brodie in 1946, that the existence of nuclear weapons mant that there oculd never be a total war between the superpowers.

 With both sides agreeing on the idea of MAD. They still continued to build up their nuclear arsenals albeit with some caveats as both saw the need for agreements on how to manage them. Treaties such as 
 - The Test-ban Treaty, which stopped nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere in 1968
 - Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty in 1968 which stopped nuclear nations from sharing relevant information and technology to non-nuclear nations
 - Strategic Arms Limitation Interim Agreement in 1972, restricted the number of land and sea based ballistic missiles
 - Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, banned defences against long-range missile so that both sides could ensure the stability of MAD and that neither side could feel confident about their defensive capability
