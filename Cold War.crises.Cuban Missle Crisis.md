## Prelude

### US stakes in the region
- The US since 1823 have a stake in the affairs of nations within the Americas which was solidified in the form of the Monroe Doctrine. This declaration was consistenly used by the US to justify their intervention into the Americas many times.

- 1947, Rio Pact was fromed and 1 year later in 1948, the Organisation of American States (OAS) was formed. The former being a much more codefied variant of the Monroe Doctrine and the later being a rather explicit denouncement of communism as being imcompatible with the ideal of American Freedom.

- American intervention prior can already be seen in 1954 where Guatemala, a democratically elected with no ties to communism was overthrown by the US due to them intiating a land reform programme which the Eisenhower saw as the first steps towards communism.

- The situation in Cuba was extremely poor as most of the economy was controlled by American companies. Furthermore, half of the land and most of the industries as well were owned by US Companies.

- Cuba was led by a dicator by the name of Batista whom was supported by the US government

### Background on Castro

- Was a young radical lawyer who was a member of the reformist Cuban People's Party, wanted to get a seat in the House of Representative through the 1952 election which was cancelled as Batista carried out a coup in the same year.

- Castro organised an armed opposition and attacked in 1953 with an attack on an army barrack. Failed and was setenced to 15 years imprisonment. He was only jailed for 2 years as he was released in 1955.

- He returned in 1956 and started a guerrilla war, after two years, in January 1959 the Bastista regime collapsed.

- Castro wanted to get rid of rampant corruption in Cuba and the economic dependence on the US.

- Castro tried to enlist the economic and political support of the US but Eisenhower refused to meet him.

- Castro started a land reform programme in 1960 and foreign companies were nationalised step by step. In October, the Us responded with a trade embargo which pushed the Cubans to negotiate a trade agreement with the USSR. Even now, Castro was still not an outspoken communist.


### Perspectives on Castro's Communism

- The revolution was intentionally undefined so that Castro can exploit the east-west rivalry and to advance his cause by railing against US imperialism .
- Castro never officially decalred himself as a communist, he only did so in December 1961 after the Bay of Pigs. Castro was forced to do so as the US embargo left him with no choice but to save Cuba with the help of the USSR.

- The other perspective was that Castro was aware of what happened to Guatemala in 1954. Castro knew that had he declared himself as a communist, he would have been overthrown by the US thus disguised his belief for tactical reason. This perspective assumed that Castro was a communist since the beginning.

## Causes

- Kennedy inherited the plan left behind by the previous administration to attack Cuba. This plan was implemented on the Bay of Pigs on **17 April 1961**, this plan failed castatrophically that it resulted in Kennedy being forced to take responsibility and causing him to have an obsession with Cuba

-  On the Soviet end of the spectrum, the Cuban had asked for support and the Soviet thought placing nuclear missles was a great idea for several key reasons (Operation Anadyr):

    1. Khrushchev wanted to protect Cuba
    2. There was a massive nuclear gap between the Soviets and the Americans with the soviet on the losing side, placing IRBM on Cuba would reduce the nuclear inferiority of the Soviet and also save the cost of building up an arsenal of ICBMs.
    3. The US had placed missiles in Turkey which alrmed the Soviets as now the USSR is surrounded by American bombers and missiles
    4. Cuba can potentially be the springboard to spread communism into South America
    5. Propaganda as the Soviets could claim they were protecting a small nation against Super Power aggressor
    6. Bargaining position of the US
    7. Show toughness to his critics in China and the USSR.
    8. Khrushchshev felt a need to find success elsewhere especially after the failure of Berlin and that the Berlin crisis by now had already been blown over by now.
    9. Khrushchev gambled that the missiles won't be discovered until they are operational and plan to announce them after the US november election.

- For Kennedy, the reason for why a response was crucial is because of:

    1. The Monroe doctrine and the OAS resue to have any foreign intervention from a European power much less a communist one.
    2. Political concerns, the mid terms in the US was comming up, a Cuban Missile Fiasco would have weakened Kennedy and his democrats and potentially lead to impeachment. It's important to remember that Kennedy campaigned on a platform of "losing" and Cuba and the Missile Gap and wouldn't have been a good look for Kennedy.



## Timeline of events

- 11th September 1962 - Kennedy warned Khrushchev that the US would prevent the installation of Soviet Nuclear missiles with Khrushchev replying that he had no intention of doing so.
- 14th October 1962 - U2 spy-planes revealed eveidence of Soviet Medium-range missile base in Cuba
- 16th OCtober 1962 - The ExComm was formed. Possible solutions to resolving the crisis were:
    - Invasion, direct fight with the Red Army
    - Surgical Strike followed by an invasion, an air strike wouldn't have destroyed the missiles
    - A blockade, granted time for diplomatic solution but have a lot of potential to backfire
- 22nd October 1962 - Kennedy gave a TV speech annoucing the existence of the missiles and blockade. Massive retaliation and mutual assured destruction became potential realities. 
- 23rd October 1962 - Khrushchev issued a reply that the Soviet Ships wouldn't respect the blockade.
- 24th October 1962 - Russian Ships finally turned back before even meeting the limit set by the US. At the same time, the US announced that the US would invade Cuba if the missiles were not removed at once.
- 25th October 1962 - The US began to into effect plans for an air-strike against the missile sites, to take place on 29 or 30th October.
- 26th October 1962 - Khrushchev sent an offer to Kennedy that nuclear missiles would be withdrawn if the US promised to never invade Cuba. Furthermore, the missiles were already operational and that the Russian Commander was authorised to launch short-range missiles in self defense without consulting Moscow.
- 27th October 1962 - Khrushchev followed up with stating that a deal must include removal of NATO missiles in Turkey. Khrushchev also suggested that this could be done via the UN. ExComm after intense discussions agreed that the second lette should be ignored and replied to the first letter on the condition the Soviet remove the missiles first otherwise known as the "Trollope ploy". On the other hand, Robert Kennedy was meeting the Russian ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin in secret. Robert Kennedy was instructed to tell the ambassador that the US would attack the USSR if they don't removed the missile by the 28th October, however there was also a condition of that if the missiles were removed from Cuba, the US would do so at well in Turkey but stressed that this wouldn't be part of any public deal. J.F.Kennedy knew that a removal of the missiles in Turkey needed consultations with NATO and could risk the end of NATO if it be known that the US was willing to sacrifice European security for American interest. Back at the forefront, a U2 spy plane was shot down with the pilot killed leading to US advisors recommending an assault on Cuba.
- 28th October - A deal was made and that the USSR accepted the terms the US provided through Khrushchev informing Kennedy via Radio Moscow while secretly Khrushchev agreed with the secret compromise Kennedy provided. Castro was not informed and refused UN inspection of the dismantling of the missiles. Another reason for not allowing inspection as he saw it as an infringement of sovereignty. The crisis has now ended with:
    - the removal of Soviet missiles in Cuba
    - American pledge to never invade Cuba
    - The secret removal of US Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

## Additional Information during the event
- Despite information about the increased of Soviet activity in Cuba, Washington ignored it until U2 planes photographed missiles being installed.
- The US didn't informed any of its allies about the existence of the missiles until 21st of October after made up his mind on what course to take.

- The US had already preapared an invasion force to be ready by 20 of October.
## Consequences
1. The US was forced to tolerate a communist state in the Caribbean. This strained the US relation with Cuba and the embarge was not lifted. Even then the US continued covert operations and plans to assassiante Castro in Cuba.
2. The time had come for a more constructive dialogue. Led to the realisation of how close the world ended and contributed to the development of detente.
3. A Test Ban Treaty in 1963 forbade the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere.
4. A Hot Line between the White House and Kremlin was established. This showed that "brinkmanship" was exceptionally dangerous especially with nuclear weapons.
5. Khrushchev was criticsed by Mao in China and Moscow. This was one of the reason that led to eventual dismissal in 1964. Thanks to the secretive nature of the deal presenting Krushchev as the man who stepped down.
6. Led to Soviet Leaders taking a much more serious effort in closing their missile gap which had far-reaching consequences for the Soviet Economy.
7. Further strained Sino-Soviet relations as it showed that the USSR was not willing to stand up against the US and thus needed to develop their own foreign policy.
8. The Allies in Europe was furious especially France at how the US had barely consulted its allies during the crisis, despite the risk that any conflict between the US and USSR would involved the other members of NATO. This resulted in Charles Gaule withdrawing France from NATO, and tried to encourage the rest of Europe to pursue an independent foreign policy.
9. Brought about a partial thaw and a first step towards the halting of the nuclear arms race.
10. Cuba tried many times to export revolution, a foreign policy at odds with that of the USSR. One reason for this is that Cuba didn't likehow the USSR had used Cuba to contest the USA. With Guevara failed revolution in Bolivia in 1965 and death in 1967, Castro began to keep more in line with Moscow even more so with Cuba increased dependence on the USSR. 

## Perspectives on the Event
- Orthodox historians saw that the the missiles were an intolerable provocation and that Kennedy responded due to a desrie to defend **legitimate secruity needs**, preserve NATO and show American Credibility. Not to mention that the Soviet had reply with no intention to deploy missiles on Cuba early on. The quarantine was a succesful strategy and that Kennedy was a skillful leader in times of crisis.
- Revisionits argued that Kennedy risked a war over Cuba for domestic political gains. Confrontation would've made it possible to get the missiles out before the November elections. Kennedy also risked a revolt from the military from doing so as well. The blockade was irresponsible and illegal as it was international waters that was being blocked and made Kennedy be seen neurotic. Not to mention the US had provoked the Soviets by establishing missiles in Turkey leading the Cuban fiasco.
- Extra, Mikhail Gorbachev concluded that both were to blame: _"The Cuban Missile crisis reminds me of two boys fighting in the schoolyard over who has the bigger stick"_

## Quotes
"The 1930s taught ws a clear lesson: aggressive conduct, if allowed to go unchecked and unchallenged ultimately leads to war. This nation is opposed to war. We are also true to our word. Our unswerving objective, therefore, must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the Western Hemisphere." Kennedy's Quarantine Speech

"They talk about who won and who lost. Human reason won. Mankind won." Khrushchev
